# Context: 
IGR201a: 3D application development/ OpenGL intro

# Lab Assignment:
The lab consists in creating a simple solar system animation (3 bodies: sun + earth + moon) in OpenGL.

# Setup:
Lab Materials (basic code to run an empty window) + Lab Assignment + [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/)'s tutorials

C++/ Visual Studio 2019/ GLFW/ GLAD/ GLM 

# State:
finished

# Objectives successfully achieved:
→ rendering a single triangle: using vertex buffer and index buffer.

→ coloring the triangle: adding a color buffer and updating the shaders

→ rendering correctly a sphere: transforming a plane mesh to a sphere mesh

→ creating the Mesh class

→ implementing the Phong shading model

→ implementing different model matrices to the same mesh to render multiple spheres

→ modifying the model matrices to animate the sphere (using glfwGetTime)

→ mapping a texture to the model instead of the color buffer

→ adding a camera mode feature and implementing a simple version of fly like camera: the user can place the camera and the look-to vector to any body (earth, moon, sun) or to a fixed point in space.

# New Skills:
 - Setting up an OpenGL project (linking libraries/ managing include files) with Visual Studio
 - Understanding the fundamentals modern OpenGL's rendering pipeline
 - Understanding the different Coordinate Systems (local->world->view->clip->screen)
 - Creating a window
 - Generating a mesh and rendering it
 - Mapping a terxture
 - Applying transformations (math calculations using GLM)
 - Writing shaders to implement the Phong  model
